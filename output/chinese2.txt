What is valve and electric actuator assembly testing?

Answer 5
According to API-SPEC-17D 7.10.4.1.13,(经检查最后应为3)
For a fail-closed (fail-open) valve, with the assembly subjected to external hydrostatic pressure (actual or simulated) of the maximum rated water depth and full rated bore pressure, applied as a differential across the gate, it shall be shown that the valve opens (closes) fully from a previously closed (open) position with a maximum of 90 % of the minimum electric power, applied to the actuator, PMR.
For a fail-closed (fail-open) valve, with the assembly subjected to the external hydrostatic pressure (actual or simulated) of the maximum rated water depth and atmospheric pressure in the body cavity, the valve shall be shown to move from a previously fully open (closed) position to a fully closed (open) position in the event of loss of power and loss of communication. 
For a fail-in-place valve, with the assembly subjected to the external hydrostatic pressure (actual or simulated) of the maximum rated water depth, the valve shall be shown to closed or open fully from a previously open or closed position with a maximum of 90 % of the minimum electric power, applied to the actuator, PMR. A fail-in-place electric valve shall remain in position in the event of loss of power and loss of communication. 

Answer-gpt:
阀门和电动执行器组件测试涵盖了对完全组装的阀门/执行器集的性能要求。
对于失效关闭（失效打开）的阀门，当组件受到最大额定水深的外部水压（实际或模拟）和全额定孔压力（作为闸门的差压）时，应显示阀门从先前关闭（打开）的位置完全打开（关闭），并对执行器应用最大90%的最小电力，PMR。
对于失效关闭（失效打开）的阀门，当组件受到最大额定水深的外部水压（实际或模拟）和体腔内的大气压力时，阀门应显示从先前完全打开（关闭）的位置移动到完全关闭（打开）的位置，在失去电力和通信的情况下。对于失效就地的阀门，当组件受到最大额定水深的外部水压（实际或模拟）时，阀门应显示从先前打开或关闭的位置完全关闭或打开，并对执行器应用最大90%的最小电力，PMR。
失效就地的电动阀门应在失去电力和通信的情况下保持位置。[0m
